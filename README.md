# anki-prettify-themes

This repository have some CSS snippets of [pranavdeshai/anki-prettify](https://github.com/pranavdeshai/anki-prettify).

## Colors

I kept all the css flag names from the source code,
so you can apply any color you want.

However, I recommend using these official palettes.
They will tell you where and when to use these colors.
_I specifically used palette in all variants of Rosé Pine_.
